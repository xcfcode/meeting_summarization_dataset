# Meeting Summarization Dataset

Meeting plays an essential part in our daily life, which allows us to share information and collaborate with others. With the growing number of meetings, meeting summaries, aka meeting minutes could be of great value for both participants and non-participants to quickly grasp the main ideas. Thanks to the earlier publicly available datasets **AMI** and **ICSI**, meeting summarization has attracted extensive research attentions.
This code shows how we get meeting summarization pairs from the original AMI and ICSI projects.
